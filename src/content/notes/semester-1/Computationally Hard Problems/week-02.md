## What Is an Algorithm?

- **Definition:**  
    An algorithm is an _unambiguous, abstract_ description of a method for solving a problem.
    
    - **Unambiguous:** Everyone following the steps obtains the same result.
        
    - **Abstract:** Independent of machine or programming language.
        

**Example:** Recipe for baking bread — inputs (ingredients) → series of exact steps → output (bread).  This emphasizes deterministic, clearly defined input–output behavior

## Algorithm Complexity

Algorithms consume **resources**:
- ⏱ Time (primary measure)
- 💾 Memory
- 💽 I/O or storage access
- 🌐 Network use, parallelism, power, etc.
 

We normally analyze **time complexity**.

In the form of worst case and best case
