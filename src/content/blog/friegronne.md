As a web developer, I recently had the pleasure of working on a project for Friegrønne, a Danish political party. Friegrønne wanted a website that would showcase their vision and ideas to potential voters. In this blog post, I'll share my experience building Friegrønne's website using SEO and designing tools like Figma and WordPress.

## Understanding Friegrønne's Vision and Goals

Before starting any project, it's important to understand the client's vision and goals. In this case, Friegrønne wanted a website that would reflect their commitment to eco-friendliness and sustainability. They wanted a clean and modern design that would appeal to their target audience - environmentally-conscious voters.

## Designing the Website with Figma

To create a design that would meet Friegrønne's requirements, I used Figma - a collaborative interface design tool. Figma allowed me to create a wireframe and design the website's user interface (UI) in a seamless and efficient way. I started by creating a sitemap of the website, which helped me to organize the content and structure of the website.

Next, I designed the website's UI, keeping in mind Friegrønne's brand guidelines and color palette. I used a minimalist design with plenty of white space and eco-friendly imagery to create a modern and visually appealing website.

## Building the Website with WordPress

Once the design was finalized, it was time to build the website using WordPress - a content management system that powers over 40% of all websites on the internet. WordPress allowed me to easily create pages, posts, and products, and customize the website's layout and functionality.

During the development process, I also focused on optimizing the website for search engines using SEO best practices. This included optimizing page titles, descriptions, and meta tags, as well as ensuring the website was mobile-friendly and had fast loading times.

## Conclusion

Working on Friegrønne's website was a fulfilling experience, as it allowed me to contribute to a more eco-friendly future. By using designing tools like Figma and building with WordPress, I was able to create a website that met Friegrønne's vision and goals. Additionally, by focusing on SEO best practices, I helped Friegrønne's website to rank higher in search engine results pages, making it easier for potential customers to find them online.

If you're looking to build a website for your business or organization, consider working with a web developer who can help you achieve your goals and create a website that reflects your vision.
