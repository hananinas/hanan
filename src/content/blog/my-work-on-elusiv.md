## Motivation

I recently had the opportunity to work with Shopify and Ruby on a project called Elusive. My role was to develop an e-commerce website and create a seamless user experience. I also incorporated Python with the GraphQL API to enhance the functionality of the site.

## Challenges

One of the main challenges of the project was to create an e-commerce site that was both visually appealing and easy to use. To achieve this, I utilized Ruby to create dynamic web pages and Shopify to manage the e-commerce functionality. By combining these two technologies, I was able to create a site that was both aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate.

In addition to Ruby and Shopify, I also incorporated Python with the GraphQL API to enhance the functionality of the site. Specifically, I used Python to create custom scripts that automated various tasks, such as data processing and analysis. One such task involved using the GraphQL API to add products to the website. By automating this process with Python, we were able to add products to the site more efficiently and provide a better experience for our users.


## Conclusion

Overall, working on Elusive was a challenging but rewarding experience. By utilizing Ruby, Shopify, and Python with the GraphQL API, we were able to create a site that was both visually appealing and highly functional.
