I'm Hanan, a Master's student in Computer Science and Engineering at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). I founded **Elusive** and **UAI** to build human-centred products that fuse rigorous engineering with entrepreneurial speed. My current focus is blending advanced computation from my degree with the practical realities of shipping software that people genuinely enjoy using.

I thrive when I can connect strategy, deep technical work, and thoughtful design. Whether it's iterating on a startup idea or refining a production system, I gravitate toward projects where I can research, prototype, and deliver measurable outcomes.

## Skills
- React & TypeScript component systems
- Modern JavaScript frameworks and tooling
- Shopify and ecommerce integrations
- Python for data pipelines & automation
- HTML & CSS for design systems
- Java for backend and academic projects

## Projects & Experience
- **Elusive** – curating high-demand sneakers and creating a tailored shopping experience for collectors.
- **UAI** – building machine-learning driven tools to improve customer journeys, from insight gathering to automation.
- Freelance work – crafting fast, accessible web applications and marketing sites for clients across industries, always balancing aesthetics with maintainability.

In addition to venture work, my university research projects centre on algorithms, data-intensive systems, and responsible AI. I enjoy taking those explorations back into my startups and consulting work to keep everything rooted in real-world needs.
